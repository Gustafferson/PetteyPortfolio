## PhD Research Overview
The aim of my PhD is to investigate the behaviour of **soil-structure interfaces**, and improve the models engineers currently use to predict their behaviour.
**Interfaces** occur in every single civil engineering project where man-made materials meet the ground. 
Rather oddly in respect of this fact, their behaviour is not widely understood, and vast amounts of resources are spent over-engineering their designs to stave off failure from wear over long periods of time.
With a global effort to produce performance-driven design, a better understanding the *physical mechanisms*  governing interface behaviour and how that may change over time, is crucial. 
A lack of full understanding of how the engineered world responds to wear can often [lead to catastrophe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pl0rsVdXxM).
My supervisors are [Dr Charles Heron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-heron-138768a6/?originalSubdomain=uk), [Professor Alec Marshall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-marshall-8582498a/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections%3BU232wmW6T2aYDKnfWMziBg%3D%3D) and Professor Glenn McDowell.

## Other Projects
Outside the scope of my PhD work I support the research group's efforts in other areas, namely teaching and centrifuge modelling. 

### Underground Pumped Hydraulic Storage
In cooperation with [Aarhus University](https://cae.au.dk/en) and [University of Cambridge](https://www-geo.eng.cam.ac.uk/), I work on centrifuge modelling of an underground hydraulic energy storage solution.
Publications are being worked on currently...

### Under Review
- **Cyclical Shear Response of Soil-Structure Interfaces at Micro and Macro Scale**
  - With the drive to deliver performance based design, it is increasingly important to properly model soil-structure interface behaviour. 
  Traditional design of cyclical soil-structure interfaces is based on empirical methods, which does not cater for systems that experience many thousands of cycles over their life-span. 
  This study seeks to examine the behaviour of the interface in the context of abrasive wear which is shown to play a critical role at cycle numbers exceeding those previously considered. 
  It is shown that during cyclical shear loading of up to 1500 cycles, a clear change in soil particle size distribution, and abrasive wear of the structural interface occurs. These changes result in a significant variation of the interface stress ratio, which is the main parameter used in traditional design. 
  To better understand the physical interactions driving these changes, a novel single-particle interface shear apparatus was developed. 
  The shear response at single-particle scale correlates to that at the macroscopic scale,with a significant change in stress ratio observed at both scales under a constant normal load boundary condition.
  With a better understanding of the fundamental physical interaction between soils and structural interfaces, more accurate estimations of long-term cyclical shear response can be made leading to more economic and safer geotechnical designs.
 

 ## Other Interests
 
 I've got something of an addiction for sports, training for 'half-distance' triathlons, cycling road racing, golf, oh and football too. 
 When I'm not training I'm probably cooking or playing chess.
